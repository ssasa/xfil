Hi,

XFIL v2.02 ( X window Four In Line ) is a logic game.

There are simple rules:
-you are playing against the micro and you have to win over him
-there is a need to put figures into a one of seven column ,and to form
 a compose of Four In Line figures
-column pointer is moved by pressing arrow key's LEFT and RIGHT
-you put figures into pointed column by pressing DOWN arrow key or RETURN
- First to break the demo mode you have to press a 's' key (for START)
- or a 'q' for quit ,if you don't want to play
-With '+' or '-' you can change the thinking level of your oponent
(be CAREFULY because if the level is over 5 you will have to wait a lot -
 - this could be hours or 'days') so use optimization flag whan making this.

In this game you don't need a mouse, i am sorry but i haven't finished
this jet.(It will be soon available a new release of XFIL).

This is my first program in X,and i am sure there will be a lot of BUGs
and other stuffs, so please let me know for your coments(i have only tested
XFIL on Sparc micro's).Also if you have some sugesstions ,let me know...

My mail adress is:
	sasa.skevin@zems.etf.hr
or of my friend:
	mario.viljac@etf.hr

To build this you have to modify the paths in the fil.h file.
You have also to change the makefile for your micro(if you are not using 
gcc Compiler, or to modify the path for include files).


COPYRIGHT NOTICE:With this programm you can do whatever you like.

Please,give me notice ,(via E-mail) if you (dis)-like this XFIL.
I'm sorry on my bad English...


Have a nice play...
